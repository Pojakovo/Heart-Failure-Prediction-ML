# Neural-Network
# Welcome to the Heart Failure Prediction Project
Heart failure is a critical medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart failure can save lives and improve patient outcomes. This project is a proactive step towards achieving that goal. By sharing our findings and model, the healthcare community can promote the development of more effective diagnostic tools.
The Heart Failure Prediction Project is where advanced neural network models meet vital healthcare data. This project is dedicated to predicting heart failure cases with precision and care, harnessing the power of cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

# THE APPROACH
We've leveraged the capabilities of neural networks to create a robust prediction model. Using two distinct datasets, we've meticulously designed and trained our model to excel in identifying potential heart failure cases. Our methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, and rigorous evaluation to ensure the utmost accuracy.

# DATASET
We've incorporated two significant datasets into our project, allowing us to compare and contrast results effectively. These datasets provide a diverse and comprehensive range of patient information, enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
# DATASET USED

# PIPELINE
* Data Collection: We gather data from two distinct datasets
* Data Preprocessing: Data from both datasets are cleaned and preprocessed separately to ensure consistency and quality.
Steps include handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering to create relevant features for our model.
* Model Training: A neural network-based heart failure prediction model is developed and trained using the integrated dataset.
* Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed through rigorous evaluation techniques, including cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Results and Insights: The final model is capable of making heart failure predictions with a high degree of accuracy.
The project generates valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart failure risk.
