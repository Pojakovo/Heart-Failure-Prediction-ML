# Heart Failure Prediction with machine learning: A comparative study of Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network
# Welcome to the Heart Failure Prediction Project
Heart failure is a critical medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart failure can save lives and improve patient outcomes. This project is a proactive step towards achieving that goal. By sharing our findings and model, the healthcare community can promote the development of more effective diagnostic tools.
The Heart Failure Prediction Project is where advanced neural network models meet vital healthcare data. This project is dedicated to predicting heart failure cases with precision and care, harnessing the power of cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

# THE APPROACH
This project revolves around the core objective of predicting heart failure through the utilization of diverse machine learning methodologies. Our toolkit includes decision trees, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks.The heart of our work lies in a comprehensive comparative analysis of these models, with a specific emphasis on showcasing the exceptional prowess of artificial neural networks in the realm of heart failure prediction.

We've harnessed the power of cutting-edge machine learning models to create a robust prediction system. By harnessing the strengths of two distinct datasets, we've meticulously trained and fine-tuned our model for the precise detection of potential heart failure cases.
Our approach involves a rigorous pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and thorough evaluation, all aimed at achieving the highest levels of accuracy.

# DATASET
We've incorporated two significant datasets into our project, allowing us to compare and contrast results effectively. These datasets provide a diverse and comprehensive range of patient information, enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

# DATASET USED
* Link to the first dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
* Link to the second dataset:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/

# PIPELINE
* Data Collection: We gather data from two distinct datasets
* Data Preprocessing: Data from both datasets are cleaned and preprocessed separately to ensure consistency and quality.
Steps include handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering to create relevant features for our model.
* Model Training: A neural network-based heart failure prediction model is developed and trained using the integrated dataset.
* Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed through rigorous evaluation techniques, including cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Results and Insights: The final model is capable of making heart failure predictions with a high degree of accuracy.
The project generates valuable insights into the factors contributing to heart failure risk.
